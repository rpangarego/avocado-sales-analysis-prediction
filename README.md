# Avocado Sales Analysis & Prediction using Python
## Context
<p>
  Avocado is a fruit that belongs to the berry family. It comes from the avocado tree, scientifically known as Persea americana. The fruit is native to south-central Mexico but is now grown in various parts of the world with suitable climates. Avocados are known for their creamy texture and unique, nutty flavor.
Avocados have gained popularity for their potential health benefits and versatility in both savory and sweet dishes. They are a staple in many cuisines and have become a trendy and beloved ingredient in modern, healthy eating.</p>
<p>In this case study, I will explore and also predict Avocado Sales Dataset, focusing on sales within the United States. This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of transactions and market trends related to avocados, covering the period from 2015 to 2020. Finally, I build a regression machine learning model and conduct a side-by-side comparison with another model to determine the model with high accuracy.
